        <h4> Education & Experiences </h4>
        <p>
            After H.S. graduation, I attended the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, MN
            where I studied Accounting and Finance. After my first year of college I
            enlisted in the Marine Corps. (Reserve) and spent the next year in various
            parts of California. Upon returning to school I took a job in the Math School
            IT department. After three more years of school, In May 2015 I received my Bachelor's
            Degree and celebrated by taking a trip to Norway.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first job out of college was at Universal Hospital Services as a Financial Analyst.
            My primary Responsibilities in this role were to cost Hospital Technician labor hours
            and price service contracts offered to clients. After three years at UHS, I accepted
            a job at Boeing and moved to Washington. My role at Boeing was a Procurement Financial
            Analyst and my primary responsibilities were to analyze airplane parts pricing on supplier
            bids and lead negotiations with prospective suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>
            After two years at Boeing I decided to change career paths and enrolled in the Masters
            in Computer Science program at Northeastern University in Seattle. Some classes I have
            taken include Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Web Development and Data Mining.
            During my time at Northeastern I have served as a TA for two semesters and have achieved
            the AWS Cloud Architect Certification.
