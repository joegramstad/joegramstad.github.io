            This project I completed in December 2021 for an Artificial Intelligence
            class that I took. The purpose of the project was to classify comments
            that were made on Wikipedia as either hate speech or not hate speech.
            With this code I was able to correctly identify hate speech 89% of
            the time as defined by wikipedia's own censors. For this project I
            used Python with SciKit Learn in a Jupyter Notebook.

            This is a project that I undertook on my own time and is still a work
            in progress. The purpose of this project is to use historical Pokemon
            card prices to predict what the prices of those cards will be in the
            future. To achieve this I created a database of all cards on a daily basis
            and then use SciKit regression to predict what the price should theoretically
            be based on the card's features (i.e. Pokemon, Set, Year, Illustrator).

            This is a project that I undertook on my own to learn more about algorithms.
            The algorithms are broken up in to sort and search algorithms (along with
            custom data structures). Each implementation represents my preferred (i.e.
            best) method for doing so. Included are Binary search, quick sort, selection
            sort, linked list, node, queue and stack.
